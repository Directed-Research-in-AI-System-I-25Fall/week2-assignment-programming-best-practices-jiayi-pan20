# What I Have Learned

## 1. **Git Commands**
- **`git revert`**: This command allows me to temporarily revert a commit, restoring the previous commit history without altering the overall project history.
- **`git reset`**: This command is used to permanently change the commit history, effectively rolling back to a specific point in time.
- **`git checkout -b <branch_name>`**: This command creates a new branch that inherits content from the main branch, facilitating separate lines of development.
- **`git push/pull`**: These commands are essential for synchronizing changes between my local repository and the remote repository on GitHub.

## 2. **Model Inference**
- For optimal performance when using models from Hugging Face, it's recommended to utilize a GPU. Since my MacOS lacks a dedicated GPU, leveraging Google Colab is a more efficient alternative.
- It is crucial to resize images to fit the input size requirements of the model, ensuring proper functionality during inference.
